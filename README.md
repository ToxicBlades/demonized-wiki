## ‚ùì Possible  Questions

### Why no authentication and why so much static data?
This wiki prioritizes simplicity and affordability. By avoiding user accounts and relying on static generation, we can host the entire site on Vercel‚Äôs free tier, ensuring it remains free to operate.

### Will translations be added?
If this wiki gains traction, translations in other languages will be introduced. I already have tools in place to help automate and manage multi-language content.

### Why not use MDX for posts?
While MDX is powerful, it often leads to a Fandom-like feel. This wiki aims for a more authentic, handcrafted experience‚Äî"made with soul," not just markdown.
